## Student Roster

Scenario:

For this assessment, you will write a program containing two classes named student and roster, respectively. The program will maintain a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program includes student ID, first name, last name, e-mail address, age, and array of grades. The program you create will read a list of five students, with one of the students being yourself, and use the series of method calls below (see part B3 below). A well-designed program would use the principles of encapsulation and information hiding.
